# Rainfall Prediction App

This repository contains code for a Rainfall Prediction App that predicts rainfall amounts based on user-provided inputs such as date, location (latitude and longitude), and station name in 143 location in Burkina Faso. The app also classifies the predicted rainfall intensity into categories such as "No Rain", "Light Rain", "Storm", or "Flood".

## Features

- Predicts rainfall amounts for a specific date and location.
- Classifies the predicted rainfall intensity into categories.
- User-friendly interface with input fields for date, latitude, longitude, and station name.
- Pre-trained machine learning model for rainfall prediction.
- Streamlit-based web app for easy deployment.
